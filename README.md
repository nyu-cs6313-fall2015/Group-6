Our application visualizes medical costs. We've created sub-sections of diagnoses and procedures for each chronic condition and visualized it against total claims costs to determine how much each diagnosis or procedure contributes to the cost. One can also discern the variations of costs for a diagnosis/procedure and also the varied sets of diagoses/procedures that have similar cost profiles.
The app has the various procedures and conditions on the X-axis and the total costs in buckets of $10K. The saturation of color in each grid shows how many people have that total cost and underwent that particular diagnosis/procedure. The other chronic diseases can be selected via the dropdown menu on the navbar. The navbar also contains sex and race filters.
Note: Make sure both the nevbar checkbox as well as the checkbox within dropdowns are checked before you apply filters. All of them need to be checked before it works. It also might take a bit of time to refresh after filtering.
